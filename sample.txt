1.	Initialize a local Git repository
2.	Create a simple text file with 5-10 lines of content
3.	Add the file to staging and make an initial commit
4.	Make 3 separate meaningful changes to the file, committing each change with a proper commit message following Conventional Commits format
5.	Use git log to view the history of changes
6.	Use git diff to examine differences between commits
Deliverables:
•	Repository with commit history
•	Screenshot of git log output
•	Brief explanation of the changes made in each commit
This is the last line
